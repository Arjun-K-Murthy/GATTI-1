#Appium


####Appium is an open-source tool used for automating native, web and hybrid applications on iOS and Android platforms.
####It also allows us to run the automated tests on actual devices, emulators and simulators.
####It is mainly used for mobile test automation at GUI level
####It is traditionally considered a "black box" testing tool, which means it doesnot have access to your application's internal state or method. 
####But off late,thanks to Appium's Espresso driver, white box testing is also possible now.
####The tool can be used for functional testing of the apps 


##Features

*Appium supports cross-platform testing, which is, if you have the same app running on both Android and iOS, Appium can be used to run tests on both platform with minimal or no code changes. This allows reuse of code.
*It supports major programming languages: Java, Python, Ruby, C#, etc.
*It supports Selenium Webdriver API, so you don’t have to learn anything new, presuming you are already familiar with Selenium
*It supports  hybrid or web testing. It uses WebDRiver protocol, which can be used to switch between native app and web content.
*It’s an open source tool and has a broad community
	 
	 
##Pros

*Appium supports Android and iOS platforms
*Appium doesn’t require any in-app modifications for testing. An application can be tested right after it’s been downloaded and installed on the device.
*This tool allows automating web, native and hybrid applications, while also offering support for various hardware actions
*Sauce labs, guys in charge of Appium, specify in creating various well-known open source automation and manual testing solutions. As a result, Appium is frequently updated and each new release includes new useful features and bug fixes.
